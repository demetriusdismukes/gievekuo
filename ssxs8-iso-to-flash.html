                            <p> this image is either non-bootable or it uses a boot or compression method not supported by Rufus is the error i get when I try to format the iso. I'm using the settings GPT part, FAT32, 4096 clusters, everything checked. Rufus is version 2.18.1213. I have bad RAM so I want to find least buggy config before I've been using DriveDroid for a while now and am quite happy with it. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.softwarebakery.drivedroid&hl=en However, I would like to see if I can somehow connect a flash drive to my Galaxy Note 2 with my OTG cable and write whatever image file I have downloaded to the drive. It would be incredibly convenient to use DriveDroid to download whatever I wish and then write from my phone without ever having to use my laptop, and perhaps I could I have a Windows 8 iso. Is there a difference between mounting the contents to a flash drive using separate program or just extracting the contents and copying them to the flash drive? I feel like they would both do the same thing. Tried on a win10 laptop and win8.1 It goes for the full thing. Then when compete it maybe before it says it couldn’t download. There is way more than enough room on the flash drive. Edit: a 4.02gb file won’t fit in 32 gb flash drive. I have been using unetbootin to attempt to create bootable flash drives and it seems like every time I attempt i fail. I just get no OS found when I boot. I use Rufus in Windows and it works every time. Any insight. I've spent over 4 hours trying to get this junk tool to work. Nowhere is there a direct ISO file. I run the tool, it spends about 5 minutes downloading. Then it says verifying files and fails at 22% with an error saying it can't run for unknown reasons. I ran this just fine about a week ago on this same PC to install 10 on a friend's machine that had a failed HDD. I have admin rights. Figured MS was being a bitch about runnng it again so reverted to a saved image from last month.

So I have a newer nw-561 external flash but it flashes after my camera takes the picture. So if I'm in the dark or a low light room, my camera sets the shutter really low and then the external flash flashes then I just get a white exposure. It's almost if the camera isn't recognizing the flash and the flash isn't recognizing the camera. Please. Downloaded iso to flash drive and booted pc with the usb and harddrive Is the wait normal or is there a problem. Title. Here's the run down, may be a long one. - Computer runs fine - Perform Smart Defrags defrag and prioritize files to speed computer up (Not sure if this is the original issue but it's the only major thing I can think of) - Computer is fine for a day or two and generally run in sleep mode at night - Leave computer on one night, come back in the morning and it's shut down, not a big deal until I start it up. - Computer repeatedly shuts down before going to windows login screen. - When not doing. I have tried everything to get Windows 10 on my USB flash drive for my new PC. I have tried Unetbootin, Etcher, Boot Camp Assistant, and nothing is working! I thought I just needed to download the Windows 10 ISO from Microsoft and put it on a flashdrive, but I'm told I need to make it a bootable image, which I cannot seem to do! Any help with this would be so appreciated! I am on a Mac OS X El Capitan 10.11.3. 
(I won't put system spec because I don't think this has nothing to do with specs - if it does I'll edit with them) So got new ssd instead of HDD. I download Windows10 EDU off Microsoft Imagine website (https://e5.onthehub.com/WebStore/OfferingsOfMajorVersionList.aspx?pmv=769faff4-d124-e511-940e-b8ca3a5db7a1&cmi_mnuMain=bdba23cf-e05e-e011-971f-0030487d8897&ws=8f012e89-3370-e011-971f-0030487d8897&vsro=8) -- which I use the iso to flash my USB using rufus And I got the following. Such as, does it compress? Can you burn it on that Flash Drive. I'm new to DSLR and I've been experimenting with my new 50mm f/1.8 lens on my Canon T1i. I want to avoid flash at all cost. My kids are my usual subjects, but they do not sit still for a shot, and my pictures end up blurry most of the time. What settings would you recommend to get a sharper image in this situation. I am trying to install from my usb flash drive. I purchased the student upgrade version of Windows 7 this afternoon and saved it to the flash drive in ISO form. This was a newly formatted drive with nothing else on it. It is now plugged in to my Gigabyte 990fxa-ud3 mobo. Does anyone have experience installing Windows in this situation? I'm basically trying to do what is suggested in this post but not getting anywhere: http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/jxa31/windows_7_with_student_discoun. 
I ran across a nano sized pc from a number of years ago. I tried to boot it up using a distro I have on my bootable USB stick, but the bios options did not include booting from USB (USB floppy, USB CDROM, and USB ZIP drive were all OK, just nothing for USB HDD or mass storage) However, GRUB was installed (GRUB version 1.97beta or something, so GRUB2, even though that makes no sense at all) I hit "c" at boot, fooled around at the command line, even saw my flash drive's /boot subdirectory </p>
